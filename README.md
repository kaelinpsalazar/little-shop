Step 2. cd into the repo
Step 3. Run 'bundle install' in terminal

### Learning Goals:
These are the primary learning goals we had during this project:
	•	Use ActiveRecord and SQL to write queries for one-to-many database relationships
	•	Expose API endpoints to support CRUD functionality
	•	Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input
	•	Test both happy and sad path functionality based on JSON contracts
	•	Use MVC to organize code, limiting data logic in controllers and serializers
	•	Track project progress with GitHub Projects
	•	Enhance an existing frontend application by improving styling, refactoring JavaScript code, and adding new features
